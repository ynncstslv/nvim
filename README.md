# .config/nvim

This repository hosts my custom configuration for Neovim, built with productivity and extensibility in mind.

## Overview

Neovim takes the best parts of Vim and expands upon them with modern features like built-in support for Lua, asynchronous plugins, and an enhanced UI. This configuration aims to provide a feature-rich, powerful, coding environment tailored for easy-to-use development.

## Installation

1. Install Neovim:

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
sudo apt install neovim
```

2. Clone the repository inside `~/.config`:

```bash
cd ~/.config
git clone https://github.com/ynncstslv/nvim
```

2. Open `nvim`:

```bash
cd nvim
nvim init.lua
```

## Notes

This configuration is tailored to my personal workflow but can be easily adapted for other use cases. Feel free to customize it to fit your needs.
